No paid accounts are necessary; bring your own proxies or buy from any vendor. The original proxy tool, since 2006.","fullDescription":"FoxyProxy is owned and developed consistently by the same few people since 2006. It has never been sold and never will.\n\nWHAT IS IT?\nFoxyProxy is a Firefox and Chrome extension that switches an internet connection across one or more proxy servers. Proxies can be switched by:\n\n1. point-and-click of colored icons in a popup menu\n2. URL - define URL patterns with wildcards or regular expressions\n3. browser tab - set individual proxies per tab!\n4. Firefox container or Private Browsing windows - define different proxies for each container\n\nSOME FEATURES\n\n    Automatically switch proxy by: browser tab, URL patterns, firefox container, private browsing window, or manually select from a drop-down list\n    Customize colors and country flags to make it easy to see which proxy is in use\n    Import/Export all of your settings, or just URL patterns, to share with others. Optionally synchronize proxy settings with your other Firefox instances when you use Firefox Sync.\n    Keyboard shortcuts to quickly switch proxies and perform other actions\n    Turn WebRTC on/off to further limit discovery of your IP address\n    Quick-Add to quickly add new URL patterns to proxy settings\n    Globally exclude any website from all proxying\n    Built-in pattern tester to test and debug your URL patterns\n    Advanced logging shows you which proxies were used and when so you can debug problems\n    Extensive built-in help\n\n\nPERMISSIONS\n\n    downloads: Required to export the extension settings to a file. Users can import that file to other Chrome/Firefox instances, or share it with colleagues, in order to keep the same settings. It can also be backed up and used later.\n    proxy: The core function of the extension is to allow users to set the proxy server used by the browser.\n    storage: Required to store proxy server settings (hostname, port, username, and which proxy server is enabled by the user)\n    tabs: Required so that users can set separate proxies to use per tab. It is also needed for \"QuickAdd\" to quickly add a URL pattern that applies to the current/active tab. It is also used to open a URL to getfoxyproxy.org where there is online help.\n    webRequest: Required to authenticate with proxy servers via webRequest.onAuthRequired\n    webRequestAuthProvider: Required to authenticate with proxies servers via webRequest.onAuthRequired\n    browsingData: Required so the extension can delete cookies, indexedDB, and localStorage when requested by the user on the Options page (*Delete Browsing Data* button)\n    privacy: Required so the extension can call browser.privacy.network.webRTCIPHandlingPolicy to turn on/off webRTC in Chrome (*Limit WebRTC* checkbox in Options page)\n    host permission: Required to proxy all webRequests and provide proxy server authentication. all_urls is used because users may choose to load any/all URLs through proxy servers (chrome.webRequest.onAuthRequired and chrome.webRequest.onAuthRequired.addListener) . Required to proxy all webRequests and provide proxy server authentication. Also needed to get accounts details from FoxyProxy servers, if requested by the user with the Import FoxyProxy Account on the Import tab.\n\n\nNo remote code is used in this extension.\n\nWhy is there a crypto library in this extension?\nThe crypto library is needed to migrate encrypted settings from an old version to version 8.x and above. It is not used to encrypt anything; only to decrypt old data when upgrading from version 3.x -> 8.x. If you are not upgrading from 3.x, this library is never used.\n\nOpen source software\nYou can view the code yourself by unzipping the downloaded file or:\n\nhttps://github.com/foxyproxy/browser-extension","weeklyDownloads":16292,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Eric Jung","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/323/"},"developers":[{"name":"erosman","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/690471/"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/5/5857.png?modified=1702412722","width":122,"height":150,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/5/5857.jpg?modified=1702412722","thumbnailWidth":122,"thumbnailHeight":150},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/291/291136.png?modified=1702412722","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/291/291136.jpg?modified=1702412722","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"Toolbar popup.

Recover your lost work after session timeouts, network failures, browser crashes, power failures and all other things that will destroy the hard work you just put into writing that important email, essay or blog post.\n\nThis extension can also be used as an easy form filler. It will restore text and editor fields as well as various input controls. On each submission of a webform, the state of controls like radio-buttons and check-boxes are saved. You can autofill textfields and various controls in a web form using either the most used or the last used formhistory data.\n\nAll text data that has been stored can easily be retrieved and managed. This extension also offers the possibility to export/import form history data allowing you to exchange data between multiple browser configurations. You can even import data from the old (pre webextension) version.\n\nIf you experience problems regarding form history not being saved, please check if you have cookies enabled.\nThis add-on uses indexeddb to store its information and by disabling cookies this issue (see bugzilla) may prevent data to be stored. So please check the Privacy and Security preferences of the browser and make sure that cookies are accepted or Form History Control will not be able to store your data.\n\nThis add-on now uses the new mandatory WebExtensions API which no longer offers access to Firefox's built-in formhistory database. To overcome this limitation this add-on will create and maintain its own private formhistory database which initially will be empty.\nThere are however two ways to get the formhistory data from the old version back into the new version:\n\n    If you have an export file from the old version, you can simply import that file into the new version. The exportfile is compatible with the new version.\n    If you have no importfile, I published a standalone Java application that can export the formhistory data from the old version. This formhistory-export application is on github along with instruction on how to use it.","weeklyDownloads":49,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Stephan Mahieu","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/2022897/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/207/207581.png?modified=1622132535","width":986,"height":493,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/207/207581.jpg?modified=1622132535","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":266,"caption":"The main control dialog, opens from right-click menu.
