**Challenge description:**
```
Find the name of the bridge where this image was taken and the year the current bridge was built on.

**Format**: `xploit{XY_bridge_YEAR}`

```

## Solve

To solve this challenge, we need to identify the bridge the image was taken on. Doing a reverse image search in google, it immediately gives us the result The one blackfriars towers.
which is the tower the image is pointing towards. Go to google maps, search for one blackfriars tower, and use sat map to idenify the bridge.

This turns out to be name 'blackfriars' bridge.

Search for 'blackfriars bridge built on' in google and it gives us 1760. but as per the description, we need the year the **current** bridge was built on. (i.e what was it renovated.)
A Brief wikipedia search gives us the answer - 1869.
